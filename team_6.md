# Part Three
1. It gives a brief introduction to Mozilla's web-extension (add-on) API and explains how to install and run the examples in the repository. It also provides information about browser support. There is a section that directly links to CONTRIBUTING.md.

2. It uses the license to make the project open source. Without the license in the repo, this project can't be classified as Open Source. When the code is shared, the license is shared with it. 

3. The contributing file denotes the ways and procedures thorugh which people are supposed to contrubute. it tells you what you can contribute, how you can contribute, the expected coding style of contributions and guidelines. 

4. One type of contribution to this repo that doesn't require writing code is translations: a contributor can go to the `locales` sub-folder in specific folders and create a translation of the localizable strings into a new language. While code is used here, the labor and contribution at stake is not coding, but translating. 

5. It redirects users to the Mozilla Community Participation guidelines and the page to report violations. The Community Participation page aims to create an inclusive community where all people feel safe participating regardless of attributes like gender, race, ability etc. Expected behaviors include being respectful, direct but professional, inclusive and understanding different perspectives. The reporting page denotes when to report, how to give a report, and hotlines. It features a table explicitly clarifying that across 8 different cases, only two links must be used. 

6. Three types of behavior is violence and threats of violence, instigating unacceptable behavior, and personal attacks. Notably, drinking too much alcohol at an in-person forum or meeting is also explicitly unacceptable. 

7. If anyone encounters an issue, they can post a query on the official mozilla forum moderated and published by Mozilla. You can also email the dev addons mailing list or contact the addons team in a Mozilla chat room, which has 403 access denied.
