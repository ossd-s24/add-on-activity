### Question 1
The README file contains a link with examples of WebExtensions to provide context for the project itself. It explains what WebExtensions are, how to use them, how to install an example, provides information on using them with other browsers, includes documentation for more resources, provides information on how to approach encountering an issue, and states that they are open to contributions.

### Question 2
The LICENSE file is used to show that the project has a license. It needs to be in a repository because otherwise it creates legal uncertainty.

### Question 3
The purpose of the contributing file is to provide context and explanation to anyone who is interested in contributing to the project, of the correct way to contribute. It explains the types of contributions and provides guidelines, examples, and further details. There is also a LICENSE and links to places where you can connect with people who are interested or are already contributing to get help.
### Question 4
You can provide a translation into the _locales directory. This does not require code and only requires an understanding of languages involved and ability to type.
### Question 5
The purpose of the Code of Conduct is to create a safe and positive community. The goal is to welcome contributions from everyone and allow them to contribute in a constructive/healthy manner. It is a way of putting people first and to recongize the diversity of contributors.
