### Question 1
The README file contains a link with examples of WebExtensions to provide context for the project itself. It explains what WebExtensions are, how to use them, how to install an example, provides information on using them with other browsers, includes documentation for more resources, provides information on how to approach encountering an issue, and states that they are open to contributions.

### Question 2
The LICENSE file is used to show that the project has a license. It needs to be in a repository because otherwise it creates legal uncertainty.
