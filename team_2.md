## Question 1
The README.md first has a brief overview on the purpose of the repo and how to use and install example extensions. It gives a link to the credits as well as other reference pages. It also gives step by step on how to use the example extensions. The format of the readme has different reference links that would provide more insight or download locations for tools that are needed. It gives addtion information for figuring out issues and other uses for other browsers.

The contributing doc labels different types of cotributions and different ways to contribute. It gives a clear guidelines with examples for proper contributions. It also insists that coding style should be consistent. 

## Question 4
- one type of contribution to this repository that does not require writing any code is contributing a translation.

## Question 5
- Though the actual CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md document didn't include much information, it included links to Mozilla's Community Participation Guidelines and How to Report page. The Community Participation Guidelines emphasized the importance of openness, collaboration, and participation, and detailed expected behaviors from the community. It also outlined inappropriate behaviors and their consequences. Unlike other Codes of Conduct I read, it seemed like Mozilla strived to enforce these guidelines through consequences.
